                    Barnatic (2011): Juan Perusin and Jeroni Castellá are Barnatic. These two musicians from Barcelona,
                    after having worked for several years on the songs of each other and having worked together as
                    session musicians in live concerts, decided to compose an album together and create a band composed
                    primarily of these two guys. A duo that, however, sounds like a band. Jero with his Chapman Stick (a
                    complex instrument that could be described as a bass and a guitar simultaneously) and vocals; and
                    Juan on drums, piano, vocals, voice-over, lyrics and music production. The two using midi sounds
                    occasionally. During the recording sessions, the duo featured some musicians and friends whom they
                    expect also to collaborate on some of their concerts.The band made two kinds of concerts: The basic
                    concert with the duo playing different elements according to the song and the big one with all the
                    musicians who collaborated on the album and/or others. The album features: Guillermo Cides on
                    stick-guitar, Chikiboom vocal trio, Luc Suarez on slide-guitar, Albert Miguez on Hammond and Clara
                    Manjón on cello.
